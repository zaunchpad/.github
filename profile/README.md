What Zaunchpad Fixes
Problems with traditional token launches that put your privacy and strategy at risk

Alpha Leaks
01. Alpha Leaks
Early investors get exposed. Blockchain transparency reveals early investment positions to competitors and copycats.

The Whale Watchers
02. The Whale Watchers
Privacy concerns for big players. Major investors don't want their early alpha strategies and positions publicly visible.

Liquidity Silos
03. Liquidity Silos
Cross-chain liquidity barriers. Traditional token launchpads can't pool liquidity from multiple blockchain networks.

The Bridge Trap
04. The Bridge Trap
Limited claim flexibility. Token launches force you to claim on their native chain, restricting your options.



What YOU GET
Zaunchpad uses the Zcash Unified Shielded Pool to mathematically sever the link between capital origin and token destination.


01

Pay in any token
Flexible payment options across multiple blockchains and assets. Contribute using ETH, USDC, NEAR, or other supported tokens from any chain.

02

The Shielded Settlement
All transactions protected by Zcash's privacy-preserving technology. Your contributions are completely shielded from public blockchain surveillance.

03

Claim via ZK Proof Tickets
Claim tokens on Solana using zero-knowledge proof tickets. No on-chain link between your funding source and claim destination.



Technology Stack
Built on unstoppable private cross-chain infrastructure.

ZCASH
https://z.cash
Settles into shielded pools and price in Zcash.

NEAR Intents
https://near-intents.org
Cross-chain swaps to deposits in any chains and from Zcash shielded pools to Solana

Solana

Liquidity layer, tokens originally minted using launchpads like Meteora

Phala Network

TEE for verifying NEAR Intents ZCash cross-chain transactions and generating zkSNARK proofs

TukTuk by Helium
https://tuktuk.funTwo powerful workflows: buying tokens privately and creating your own launch

### Buying Tokens

1
Deposit with any asset
Using NEAR Intents, the system automatically swaps your deposit to Zcash based on ticket amount. Support for ETH, USDC, NEAR, and more.


2
ZK-SNARK proof generation
Generates a zero-knowledge proof that acts as an IOU of predetermined amount at the mint price. This proof is your claim ticket.


3
Capital allocation
Allocated capital is deposited into the Meteora pool, providing liquidity for the token launch while maintaining your privacy.


4
Flexible claiming
With the claim system via proofs, you can either claim on Solana or bridge via omni token to claim on your desired Layer Zero OFT supported
Solana automation framework for taking Solana liquidity and putting into Meteora contracts

### Create Token Launch
1
Set pricing
Outline price and number of tokens per Zcash. Define your token economics and allocation strategy.


2
Multi-chain configuration
Choose whether to enable Layer Zero for multichain claims and select which supported chains your token can be claimed on.


3
Timeline setup
Define how long the token sale runs, when it starts, and when the claim period begins. Set specific dates and durations.


4
Minimum requirements
Set minimum thresholds for successful token launch and claim eligibility. Protect both you and your investors.
